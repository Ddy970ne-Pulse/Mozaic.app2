# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "CRITICAL INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTED: Fixed major issue where imported absences were not visible in Monthly Planning. Added loadImportedAbsences() function that calls new GET /api/absences/by-period/{year}/{month} endpoint. Created updatePlanningFromImportedAbsences() function to merge imported absences with approval requests. Supports employee matching by ID, name, or nom+prenom. Handles both French (DD/MM/YYYY) and ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) date formats. Generates absence periods based on jours_absence count. Maps motif_absence to absence codes (CA, AM, REC, etc.). Now ALL imported absences are automatically displayed in Monthly Planning calendar with proper color coding and integrated with absence request system."

SOLUTION: Completely removed all tile movement effects (hover:scale-110, hover:-translate-y-2, hover:shadow-2xl, transform-gpu) from tile button elements, kept ONLY group-hover:scale-110 on icon div, applied consistently to ALL menu tiles. NOW: Only icon enlarges on hover, tile remains completely stable - no movement, no shadow change, no scale. 2) ANALYTICS CONSOLIDATION: Created AnalyticsHub.js - unified hub interface with 3 large module cards (Analyse des Absences, Analytics & KPI, Rapports Standards), each with gradient header, description, availability indicator, hover animations. Replaced 3 separate menu tiles with SINGLE 'Analytics & Rapports' tile (gradient indigo‚Üípurple‚Üípink). Menu cleaner (3‚Üí1 tile), centralized access with overview statistics. 3) CA DEDUCTION VERIFICATION: Verified absenceRules.js - CA correctly uses 'working_days' method, excludes Sundays (excludeSundays: true), excludes holidays (excludeHolidays: true), calculation logic line 281-293 implements Monday-Saturday counting correctly, legally compliant with Art. L3141-3. No changes needed. Created comprehensive documentation UI_ANALYTICS_GROUPING_FIX.md. Frontend restarted. Ready for user testing: hover effects, analytics hub navigation, CA calculations."

PROBLEM: Excel files use time format like '5:00' for hours worked, but the import module was not converting this to decimal numbers required by the backend. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Created convertTimeToDecimal() function to handle multiple time formats: Excel decimal fractions (0.208333 = 5 hours), HH:MM string format ('5:00' ‚Üí 5.00, '5:30' ‚Üí 5.50), Plain numbers (already in decimal format), 2) Enhanced processExcelValue() function with time column detection using keywords (heure, heures, travaill√©es, travaillees, travail), 3) Automatic conversion with logging for transparency ('5:00' ‚Üí '5.00h', '5:30' ‚Üí '5.50h'). BACKEND COMPATIBILITY: Verified that ImportWorkHours model accepts float type for heures_travaillees field (line 476), POST /import/work-hours endpoint properly converts to float (line 2050). SUPPORTED FORMATS: String format 'HH:MM' (e.g., '5:00', '12:30'), Excel time decimals (e.g., 0.208333 for 5 hours), Plain numbers (e.g., '5', '5.5', 5.0).

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: 1) Imported work hours stored in db.work_hours collection, 2) Overtime module reads from db.overtime collection, 3) No integration between the two collections causing data isolation. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) BACKEND ENDPOINT ENHANCEMENT (server.py line 2765): Modified GET /api/overtime/all endpoint to fetch from BOTH collections (db.overtime AND db.work_hours), Imported work hours automatically treated as 'accumulated' overtime, Each work_hours record adds to employee's accumulated hours with 'Heures import√©es' reason and pre-validated status. 2) EMPLOYEE LOOKUP FIX (server.py line 2033): Fixed POST /import/work-hours to search in db.users collection first (where employees are actually stored), Added fallback to db.employees for compatibility, Resolved 'Employ√© non trouv√©' error for valid employee names. 3) DATA AGGREGATION: Overtime module now shows combined data from both sources, Details section includes imported hours with proper metadata (date, hours, type, reason, validation status), Balance calculations include all imported work hours. TESTING PERFORMED: Successfully imported 2 work_hours records for Di√©go DACALOR (5.5h + 7.0h = 12.5h total), Verified data appears in GET /api/overtime/all with correct aggregation, Confirmed department info retrieved from users collection.
