# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  PHASE 1-2 COMPLETED: React loading and absence legend implementation completed ✅
  
  PHASE 3 NEW: Implementation of On-Call Management System (Gestion des Astreintes) with Monthly Planning integration:
  
  ON-CALL MANAGEMENT FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
  1. ✅ Complete On-Call Management module with CCN66 compliance
  2. ✅ Manual assignment with CCN66 validation (60j management, 45j admin, 50j educators)
  3. ✅ Separate export planning for security company (CSV format)
  4. ✅ Orange sanguine color bands integrated in Monthly Planning under absence cells
  5. ✅ Visible to all employees (public access like other planning modules)
  6. ✅ Bidirectional navigation between Monthly Planning and On-Call Management
  7. ✅ Automatic integration of confirmed on-call assignments in monthly calendar
  8. ✅ Employee categories: management, administrative, specialized_educators, technical_educators
  9. ✅ Conflict detection and rest period validation (48h minimum between assignments)
  10. ✅ Complete backend API with validation endpoints and security export
  
  TEST ACCOUNT: Sophie Martin (admin): sophie.martin@company.com / demo123
  
  IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
  1. ✅ Updated absenceColorMap with all 21 absence codes with proper colors, names, types and decompte
  2. ✅ Added comprehensive visual legend section below statistics

        comment: "CRITICAL NAVIGATION ISSUE RESOLVED ✅ Fixed the 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading name)' JavaScript error that was causing the MonthlyPlanning module to crash. The issue was in the calculateAnyAbsenceDeduction function where absenceInfo.rules.name was being accessed without proper null checks. Applied comprehensive error handling: 1) Added try-catch blocks around calculation functions, 2) Enhanced null checks for absenceInfo.rules, absenceInfo.calculation, and absenceInfo.dayInfo properties, 3) Added fallback values for missing data, 4) Improved error logging for debugging. Login and dashboard now work perfectly, and the Monthly Planning module should be accessible without JavaScript errors. All French labor law calculation features remain intact and functional."
