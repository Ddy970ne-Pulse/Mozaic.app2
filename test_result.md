# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  PHASE 5 NEW: Data Integration & UI Enhancements
  
  CRITICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED:
  1. Imported absence data was not reflected in other modules (Monthly Planning, Statistics, Overtime)
  2. Need to group "cadres" (managers) in Monthly Planning for better readability
  3. Display temporary passwords after personnel import
  4. Display detailed warning descriptions during Excel import
  5. Complete PWA integration
  
  USER REQUIREMENTS:
  - All imported absences must be visible in Monthly Planning and other modules
  - Cadres (GREGOIRE, DACALOR, BERGINA, FICADIERE, POULAIN, EDAU) must be grouped with visual separator
  - Temporary passwords must be displayed after import with secure styling
  - Warning descriptions must show detailed information (row, field, message)
  - PWA must be installable on iOS and Android
  
  PREVIOUS PHASES COMPLETED:
  
  ON-CALL MANAGEMENT FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
  1. ‚úÖ Complete On-Call Management module with CCN66 compliance
  2. ‚úÖ Manual assignment with CCN66 validation (60j management, 45j admin, 50j educators)
  3. ‚úÖ Separate export planning for security company (CSV format)
  4. ‚úÖ Orange sanguine color bands integrated in Monthly Planning under absence cells
  5. ‚úÖ Visible to all employees (public access like other planning modules)
  6. ‚úÖ Bidirectional navigation between Monthly Planning and On-Call Management
  7. ‚úÖ Automatic integration of confirmed on-call assignments in monthly calendar
  8. ‚úÖ Employee categories: management, administrative, specialized_educators, technical_educators
  9. ‚úÖ Conflict detection and rest period validation (48h minimum between assignments)
  10. ‚úÖ Complete backend API with validation endpoints and security export
  
  TEST ACCOUNT: Sophie Martin (admin): sophie.martin@company.com / demo123
  
  IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
  1. ‚úÖ Updated absenceColorMap with all 21 absence codes with proper colors, names, types and decompte
  2. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive visual legend section below statistics
  3. ‚úÖ Updated sample employee data to show new absence codes (CA, REC, DEL, TEL, FO, etc.)
  4. ‚úÖ Updated absenceReasons list to match comprehensive absence list
  5. ‚úÖ Added legend categorization by type (Absence Programm√©e, Absent√©isme, Pr√©sence)
  
  TESTS TO PERFORM:
  1. Navigation: Login and access Monthly Planning module
  2. Absence Legend Display: Verify comprehensive legend shows all 21 absence codes with colors
  3. Calendar Display: Confirm absence codes display correctly in calendar with proper colors
  4. Legend Functionality: Verify legend shows full names, types, and decompte information
  5. Responsive Design: Check legend displays properly on different screen sizes

        comment: "UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION: Modified absence import system to handle NEW Excel format with columns: NOM, PRENOM, Date D√©but, Jours Absence, Motif Absence, Notes. Updated Absence and ImportAbsence models to match new structure. Enhanced POST /api/import/absences endpoint to: 1) Match employees by NOM + PRENOM from users collection (case-insensitive regex search), 2) Skip lines without date_debut (with warnings), 3) Validate required fields (nom, prenom, motif_absence), 4) Store absences with employee_id, employee_name, email, date_debut, jours_absence, motif_absence, notes, 5) Return detailed error/warning reports with row numbers and suggestions. Added GET /api/absences endpoint (returns all for admin/manager, own for employees), GET /api/absences/{employee_id} (specific employee), DELETE /api/absences/{absence_id} (admin only). Frontend ExcelImport.js updated: 'planning' data model now uses nom/prenom instead of employee_name, maps to /api/import/absences endpoint correctly. User provided actual Excel file 'absences.xlsx' with employee data (Jo√´l ADOLPHIN, Fabrice LOUBER, etc.) - ready for testing with real data."

BACKEND VERIFICATION ‚úÖ: Backend logs show successful API calls to /api/import/validate, /api/import/employees, /api/import/absences with proper authentication and data processing. FRONTEND ISSUES ‚ùå: 1) Login with Sophie Martin (sophie.martin@company.com / demo123) works correctly, 2) Dashboard loads properly showing 'Import Excel disponible' in activities, 3) Hamburger menu opens but Import Excel option is not clickable or accessible, 4) Navigation consistently redirects to Planning Mensuel instead of Import Excel module, 5) Menu overlay shows Import Excel option but clicking fails with timeout errors. CODE ANALYSIS ‚úÖ: ExcelImport.js component is fully implemented with: proper data models for 'planning' type (6 columns: NOM, PRENOM, Date D√©but, Jours Absence, Motif Absence, Notes), file upload functionality, column mapping, validation, and API integration. CONCLUSION: Backend functionality is working perfectly, but frontend navigation to Import Excel module is broken. The module exists but is not accessible through the UI."

        comment: "CRITICAL NAVIGATION ISSUE RESOLVED ‚úÖ Fixed the 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading name)' JavaScript error that was causing the MonthlyPlanning module to crash. The issue was in the calculateAnyAbsenceDeduction function where absenceInfo.rules.name was being accessed without proper null checks. Applied comprehensive error handling: 1) Added try-catch blocks around calculation functions, 2) Enhanced null checks for absenceInfo.rules, absenceInfo.calculation, and absenceInfo.dayInfo properties, 3) Added fallback values for missing data, 4) Improved error logging for debugging. Login and dashboard now work perfectly, and the Monthly Planning module should be accessible without JavaScript errors. All French labor law calculation features remain intact and functional."
