The previous AI engineer focused on robustly enhancing the MOZAIK RH application, reacting dynamically to user feedback and critical bug reports. Initially, the goal was to finalize PWA conversion, but the trajectory quickly pivoted to implementing complex features like Absence and CSE Management modules. This involved extensive iterative development on both frontend (, , ) and backend (), including defining new data models, endpoints, and intricate data processing logic for Excel imports (e.g., date formats, CSE member identification, handling optional fields, generating temporary emails). Significant effort was dedicated to debugging, particularly resolving login issues, ensuring full Excel row imports despite filtering challenges, and cleaning test data. The most recent work addresses critical  bugs in  (fixed) and  (pending).

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application requires:
1.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Revert UI, implement iOS/iCloud-like glassmorphism hamburger menu with dynamic colors, logo, iconized buttons, and harmonized action button styles.
2.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Module for personnel, absences, and worked hours import. Features: parsing, validation, preview, automatic user creation with temporary passwords. Iterative refinements ensured: correct French date mapping, automatic absence end date calculation, full row import (even with missing data), auto-generated internal emails for missing professional emails, accurate CSE member identification from a dedicated column, and correct handling of Catégorie Employé as a single field.
3.  **Admin & User Management**: Establish initial admin (Diego DACALOR), implement full User Management (CRUD, password hashing), replacing demo accounts. Includes email modification, custom modal for individual user deletion, and database cleanup.
4.  **Data Integrity & Cleanup**: Remove hardcoded demo data; store and display all optional imported fields.
5.  **Temporary Password System**: Secure auto-generated temporary passwords, requiring first-login change.
6.  **Dashboard Data**: Display real-time, dynamic data.
7.  **Event Management**: API and system for Événements à venir.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility (PWA)**: iOS/Android installable app with real-time data access.
9.  **CSE Management Module**: Designate CSE members, track/manage delegation hours (default 24h, modifiable), implement prise de connaissance validation, with alerts/blocking for quota exceedance.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main backend file for FastAPI routes, DB models, and logic.
    -   **Changes**:  model () and  model were iteratively adjusted for Excel import data structure (e.g., , , optional ).  model () and new CSE models (, ) were added. Implemented functions for  and . Backend endpoints for  (rewritten),  (GET/DELETE), and new CSE-related CRUD endpoints were created. Import logic was enhanced for CSE member detection, temporary email generation, and flexible data handling.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Global layout and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  into the hamburger menu and main view renderer. Navigation issues (previously related to test selectors) were resolved.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles Excel uploads and data import.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed dropdowns, implemented robust French date conversion. Data models for planning (absences) and employee import were updated to match evolving Excel structures. Critical fixes were applied to prevent data filtering (e.g., optional email, department) and ensure all rows were processed from Excel. Display of columns updated to 16.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for user management.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented an individual user delete button with a custom confirmation modal, distinct from the mass test user deletion.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages overtime data.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a  by adding .
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages delegation hours.
    -   **Changes**: *Identified for the same  error as .* (Fix pending).
-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance**: Frontend component for CSE member and delegation hours management.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created, integrated into the UI.
-   **, , ,  (New Files)**
    -   **Importance**: Core files for PWA functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Display Temporary Passwords**: Update  to display automatically generated temporary passwords after personnel import.
-   **Hamburger Menu Style Confirmation**: User needs to confirm preferred hamburger menu style for .
-   **PWA Integration**: Update  to include the PWA manifest and service worker.
-   **Display Warning Descriptions**: Update  to display detailed descriptions for warnings during import.
-   **Fix  in **: Declare  state to resolve the .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical runtime errors that caused the Heures Supplémentaires (Overtime) and Heures de Délégation (Delegation Hours) modules to stop functioning. The root cause was a  within these components. The fix for  was completed (Chat Message 492) by adding  to the component. The engineer has just finished this fix and is now preparing to apply the *same fix* to , which exhibits the identical error. This work is critical to restore core application functionality, specifically for managing employee overtime and delegation hours.
