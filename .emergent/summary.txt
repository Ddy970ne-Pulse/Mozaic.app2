The AI engineer's work involved a series of critical bug fixes and feature enhancements for the MOZAIK RH application. Initially, a persistent issue with absence badge display in  was resolved by fixing a  race condition. Concurrently, the backend  and  absence request endpoints in  were fully implemented to correctly persist data, synchronize counters, and handle notifications, addressing a major data flow gap. A subsequent major task was the comprehensive migration of CP (Congés Payés) absence types to CA (Congés Annuels) across the entire codebase and database. Following this, test data and hardcoded absence types were replaced with a database-driven configuration. A new module for combined absence analysis reporting was also integrated. The latest significant effort is the implementation of a multi-tenant SaaS architecture. However, the initial attempt to migrate existing data to this new architecture encountered database errors (duplicate emails, MongoDB syntax), leading to a pivot where the AI is now analyzing the ComboHR application for ergonomic and request management insights.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system for responsive personnel and absence management with a glassmorphism UI. It includes Excel import, auto-generated credentials, and CSE member identification. Core features encompass robust user management, data integrity, temporary passwords, dynamic dashboards, and PWA mobile accessibility. The CSE Management Module tracks delegation hours. It requires robust temporal data handling for planning and analytics, overtime/recovery integration, and a personal employee space detailing absences. Absence calculations must respect weekends/holidays and priority rules, tracking specific types in hours. Admins can modify any absence, create/manage absences on monthly planning (multi-employee selection, copy/paste, recurring templates). Managers/RH validate others' requests (but not their own) and overtime. All data changes must propagate instantly, supported by a dynamic notification system and user feedback for synchronization. Recent work ensured accurate absence badge display and a complete backend approval/rejection workflow for absence requests.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in two concurrent, high-priority tasks:
1.  **Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation and Data Migration**: The user provided a detailed architectural plan for a multi-tenant SaaS solution, including backend (, ,  modifications) and frontend () components. This architecture has been largely implemented. The next step was to migrate existing application data to this new multi-tenant structure for the first specified tenant, AAEA CAVA. However, an attempt to execute the  script failed, encountering MongoDB errors related to duplicate emails and syntax issues (e.g., , ).
2.  **Competitor Analysis (ComboHR)**: Due to the blockage in the multi-tenant migration, the user requested a pivot: to analyze the ComboHR application for interesting functionalities, focusing on ergonomics and how absence requests are managed. The AI is currently in the process of fulfilling this request, having just completed the information gathering phase by analyzing ComboHR's public site and documentation. The next step is to compile this analysis into a report.
