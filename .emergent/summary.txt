The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the MOZAIK RH application, focusing on several key areas. Initially, the engineer addressed user feedback on the hamburger menu's animation, optimizing its display speed and transition effects to use horizontal movements instead of rotations, ensuring all tiles animated smoothly. Subsequently, the engineer harmonized the style of action buttons across the application, starting with the header and then extending to various modules like Monthly Planning and Analytics, replacing text-heavy buttons with icons and consistent gradient styles. Finally, the engineer developed and integrated a new Excel import module. The work culminated in the successful analysis of an uploaded  file, identifying its data structure for subsequent mass integration. The process involved iterative development, test page creation, and verification through screenshots and automated testing.

<product_requirements>
MOZAIK RH is an HR management application compliant with French labor law. The trajectory details the fulfillment of several user requirements:
1.  **KPI Report Enhancement**: Improved presentation of Personnel Turnover reports with dynamic charts and selectors. (Completed earlier, referenced in initial context).
2.  **UI Reversion & Hamburger Menu Styling**: Reverted UI to original MOZAIK RH style, restoring the iOS/iCloud-like hamburger menu. This menu was then adapted to match the login page's glassmorphism aesthetic, featuring reduced tile sizes, dynamic colors, integrated logo, and iconized action buttons.
3.  **Hamburger Menu Dynamics**: Enhanced the deployed hamburger menu with dynamic effects similar to the login page's animated background and sophisticated tile animations, specifically optimizing for faster, horizontal movements.
4.  **Action Button Harmonization**: Reworked action buttons in the header and across various modules (Monthly Planning, Analytics, Dashboard) to use icons and a consistent gradient style, matching the application's overall aesthetic.
5.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Developed a new module to allow mass integration of data via Excel spreadsheets, including file parsing, validation, and preview capabilities.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (Python backend).
-   **React State Management**: Use of Hooks (, ).
-   **UI/UX Design**: Responsive CSS, glassmorphism, gradients, animated elements, icon usage.
-   **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
-   **Excel Data Processing**: Integration of  library for frontend Excel file parsing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a monorepo structure, separating the React frontend from the FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines the global application layout, navigation, and header. It houses the hamburger menu logic and UI.
    -   **Changes**: Received significant modifications for animation optimization (reducing display time, changing rotations to horizontal movements) for the hamburger menu. Also, updated to integrate harmonized header action buttons with consistent gradient styles, shadows, and rounded corners. It was further modified to add the new  component to its navigation and rendering logic.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main dashboard page of the application.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to harmonize its action buttons, applying the new consistent style.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Displays KPI reports and analytics.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to harmonize its action buttons, applying the new consistent style.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages the monthly planning module.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly updated to replace long-text action buttons with icons and harmonize their style with the new application standard.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The login page, whose styling (glassmorphism, gradients, animated clouds) served as a reference for the hamburger menu.
    -   **Changes**: No direct modifications in this trajectory segment, but its styles were referenced extensively.

-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance**: A newly created component for handling Excel file uploads, parsing, validation, and preview.
    -   **Changes**: Contains the logic and UI for the new mass data integration feature.

-   ****: Several temporary test pages (, , , , ) were created to incrementally validate UI changes and new features before full integration.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement Data Integration Logic**: Integrate the parsed data from the  file into the application's database and relevant modules (e.g., creating personnel, filling planning, populating other modules), based on the analysis of its four main sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the mass data integration feature. A new  component was developed, integrated into the  navigation, and the  library was installed. The module was successfully tested via  and automated tests. Following this, the user provided an Excel file (), which was initially unsupported. Upon request, the user provided an  version (). The AI engineer successfully analyzed this  file, identifying its structure into four main sections: Données Employés (13 columns), Données Absences (5 columns), Données Heures Travaillées (4 columns), and Settings. The current state is that the file has been parsed and its contents understood, ready for the next step of implementing the actual data import logic.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the backend and frontend logic to process and persist data from the analyzed  file.
