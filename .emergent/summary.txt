The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on stabilizing the MOZAIK RH application, particularly addressing critical frontend navigation and rendering issues, and then refining the Monthly Planning module. Initially, a  blocked access to , which was resolved by adding robust null checks in  and . This was followed by a prolonged struggle with non-functional quick action buttons and general menu navigation, leading to deep debugging, temporary solutions like  (later discarded due to memory leaks), and multiple full system restarts to clear persistent cache issues. A critical memory leak and high CPU usage were traced to  and  calls within the debugging attempts, which were subsequently removed. The core navigation system for the hamburger menu was eventually fixed by resolving an event name mismatch between  and . Finally, after the application became stable, the focus shifted to implementing detailed user feedback for the Monthly Planning module's visual design, absence list completeness, printing options, and automatic filling from approved requests, culminating in the creation of  and related safe versions of calculation modules.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH system aims to be a comprehensive HR management solution adhering to French labor law (CCN66), featuring a modern, responsive UI (iPad-style planning/menu). Core features include Holiday Management, Leave Entitlements, Overtime, HR Validation, Payroll Export, and Statistics. Specific requirements covered: mobile responsiveness, functional Settings, correct logo display, differentiated demo accounts, working logout, and role-based dashboards. A Delegation Hours module was required with admin designation and legal compliance. Subsequent updates added  for administrators. Recent requests focused on activating Approuver/Refuser buttons, enhancing absence legend aesthetics, synchronizing dashboard/absence data, printing planning in landscape, updating holidays, improving sort ribbon UI, disabling Payslips for RGPD, enhancing medical document security, activating Exporter/Analyser buttons, and implementing accurate French labor law calculations for annual leave (CA) and all other absence types. Latest user feedback includes: adjusting the Monthly Planning visual to a specific image, automatically populating the planning with approved absence requests, providing A4/A3 landscape printing with header repetition, allowing distinct year/month selection, fixing the Actualiser depuis demandes button, replacing the print text with an icon, removing department/job details, and grouping employees by administrative/educational/technical/managerial categories. The absence motif list needs to be complete (21 codes).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a series of critical frontend issues that were blocking the application's functionality. The initial  in the  module was fixed by adding comprehensive null and undefined checks. Subsequently, persistent navigation and click propagation issues affecting both the quick action buttons on the Dashboard and the hamburger menu items were diagnosed and addressed. This involved extensive debugging of  prop passing, temporary attempts with custom  events (which were later removed due to memory leaks and high CPU usage), and numerous system restarts to clear build caches.

A critical memory leak leading to application freezes and 99%+ CPU usage was identified and resolved by removing problematic  and  calls introduced during debugging. The fundamental menu navigation now functions correctly, allowing access to different modules.

Most recently, the user provided detailed feedback for the  module, focusing on its visual design, the completeness of the absence motif list, printing requirements, dynamic data filling from approved requests, and employee grouping. In response, a new component, , was created, along with  and  to prevent recurrence of infinite loop issues. The  error has been fixed, and the Monthly Planning module now loads and displays correctly with its basic structure, legend, and print button, ready for further refinement as per the user's latest detailed requirements. The planning is currently empty as it relies on approved requests which haven't been simulated yet.
