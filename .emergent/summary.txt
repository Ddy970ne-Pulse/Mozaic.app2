The previous AI engineer worked on critical enhancements and bug fixes for the MOZAIK RH application. Initially, the focus was on PWA conversion and implementing Absence and CSE Management modules. The trajectory then pivoted to address multiple user-reported issues: non-persisting employee data, incorrect display of imported absences in planning (due to bad mapping and temporal data leaks), hardcoded holidays, and a duplicate hamburger menu. The engineer systematically debugged and implemented fixes across both frontend and backend, refining data models, API endpoints, and UI logic. Key actions included: adding dynamic period filtering for absences, consolidating absence application logic, dynamic holiday calculation, fixing data persistence for user modifications, and unifying the mobile menu. The most recent interactions highlight regressions/unresolved bugs related to the duplicate hamburger menu and the failure to import Heures Travaillées data, leading to a new investigation.

The MOZAIK RH application aims to provide a robust HR management system with the following functionalities:

1.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Implement an iOS/iCloud-like glassmorphism hamburger menu with dynamic colors, logo, iconized buttons, harmonized action button styles, and responsive, compact tile design for mobile.
2.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Develop a module for importing personnel, absences, and worked hours. This includes robust parsing, validation, preview, automatic user creation with temporary passwords, correct French date mapping, automatic absence end date calculation based on labor law, full row import (even with missing optional data), auto-generated internal emails for missing professional emails, accurate CSE member identification, and proper handling of Catégorie Employé. The module should also display temporary passwords and detailed warning descriptions post-import.
3.  **Admin & User Management**: Establish an initial administrator (Diego DACALOR), implement comprehensive User Management (CRUD operations with password hashing), replace demo accounts, enable email modification, and allow individual user deletion via a custom modal, ensuring all manually modified employee data is persisted in the database.
4.  **Data Integrity & Cleanup**: Eliminate hardcoded demo data and ensure storage and display of all optional imported fields.
5.  **Temporary Password System**: Implement secure auto-generated temporary passwords that require a change upon first login.
6.  **Dashboard Data**: Display real-time, dynamic data.
7.  **Event Management**: Develop an API and system for Événements à venir.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility (PWA)**: Ensure the application is installable on iOS/Android as a PWA with real-time data access, including complete PWA manifest and service worker integration.
9.  **CSE Management Module**: Facilitate the designation of CSE members, track and manage their delegation hours (with a default of 24h, modifiable), and implement prise de connaissance validation with alerts/blocking for quota exceedance.
10. **Dynamic Temporal Data Handling**: Ensure all modules (e.g., Planning, Analytics) dynamically adapt to new years (e.g., 2026+), allow filtering of data by month, year, or custom period, and prevent data from bleeding or transposing across different months or years.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical, user-reported issues:
1.  **Persistent Duplicate Hamburger Menu**: The user reported (Chat Message 542) that two hamburger menus were still appearing, specifically mentioning the simple mobile menu, despite the engineer's previous attempts (Chat Messages 488, 506, 508, 512) to unify the design and remove the redundant menu in . This indicates a regression or an incomplete fix.
2.  **Overtime (Heures Travaillées) Excel Import Failure**: The user reported (Chat Message 542) that importing Heures travaillées data was failing, showing an error: ❌ Erreur lors de la lecture du fichier: Error: Aucune donnée trouvée dans le fichier Excel. This error, occurring after the user selects the data type and inserts the file, suggests a problem within 's file parsing or data filtering logic, specifically when handling Heures travaillées data. The console logs from the user's report (Chat Message 542) point to  as the origin of the Aucune donnée trouvée error.

The AI engineer's very last action (Chat Message 543) was to acknowledge both problems and state the immediate next step: Commençons par trouver ce fichier qui a le même problème :. This indicates the engineer is about to start investigating  to diagnose the import error and subsequently address the menu issue.
