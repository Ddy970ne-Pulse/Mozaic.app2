The AI engineer's trajectory involved a sequence of bug fixes, feature implementations, and architectural shifts for the MOZAIK RH application. Initially, it tackled critical fixes like the absence badge display and a full backend approval/rejection workflow. A major data migration from CP to CA absence types and database-driven configurations were completed. The core challenge became the implementation of a multi-tenant SaaS architecture, which faced initial database migration errors. This led to a pivot for a ComboHR application analysis, exploring ergonomic and request management features.

Upon resuming, the user requested to proceed through a structured plan: Stabilization (A), Multi-Tenant (B), and ComboHR Features (C). The AI engineer addressed several issues under Stabilization, including the WebSocket connection problem and a bug in the absence request UI. It also implemented a new Quick Add Absence feature inspired by ComboHR, which introduced new bugs related to missing employee email data and UI refresh issues. It cleaned up duplicate planning files. The multi-tenant migration was successfully executed. The WebSocket issue, though partially addressed by backend code, was documented as a potential Kubernetes Ingress configuration problem. Currently, the user has instructed to continue with Security Critical fixes (Option A from a newly proposed Quick Wins list), followed by other options up to G.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system for personnel and absence management, featuring a glassmorphism UI, Excel import, auto-generated credentials, and PWA mobile accessibility. It supports robust user management, dynamic dashboards, and a CSE Management Module for tracking delegation hours. Core requirements include precise temporal data handling, overtime/recovery integration, and a personal employee space. Absence calculations must respect weekends/holidays and priority rules, tracking specific types in hours. Admins can manage absences on monthly planning, while managers/HR validate requests (excluding their own). All data changes require instant propagation via a dynamic notification system.
Implemented features include: accurate absence badge display, a complete backend approval/rejection workflow, migration of CP to CA absence types, database-driven absence type configuration, a combined absence analysis report, and a multi-tenant SaaS architecture. A Quick Add Absence feature with a '+' button on monthly planning cells and a modal for rapid creation has been implemented.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Quick Add Absence feature, requested by the user. Although the UI components for the quick add were functional (button appearing, modal opening), there was a persistent bug where creating an absence resulted in a 422 Unprocessable Content API error. This was traced to the  field of the  object being  during the API call. The AI engineer attempted to fix this by modifying  to ensure the  field is populated when employee data is loaded. After multiple attempts and realizing hot-reloads weren't applying changes, a full frontend restart and cache clearing was performed under the guidance of the . The AI then added more detailed error logging.

Concurrently, there was an ongoing issue with WebSocket connections consistently failing with a 404 error, despite code-level fixes, which the AI deduced points to a Kubernetes Ingress configuration problem. This was documented.

The user then provided new instructions, requesting to start with Option A: Sécurité Critique from a list of proposed Quick Wins.
