The AI engineer's work on MOZAIK RH spanned critical bug fixes, new feature development, and architectural enhancements. Initially, efforts addressed a  error related to absence data and refined user authentication. The engineer then implemented CCN66 leave rules and a global synchronization service. Key features developed include manager overtime validation for specific employee categories, a robust notification system with individual and automatic messages, and a real-time data synchronization system using WebSockets. Significant debugging occurred around email SMTP authentication (transitioning from Gmail issues, attempting BlueMind, then finally a working Gmail app password) and persistent data handling for absence and overtime requests. UI/UX improvements like click outside to close for menus and notification panels, and enabling Planning Mensuel for all employees were also addressed. The engineer consistently addressed user feedback, debugged persistence issues, and iterated on frontend/backend logic.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system with a responsive, glassmorphism UI, focusing on efficient personnel and absence management. Key features include Excel import for personnel and absence data, auto-generated credentials, and CSE member identification. Core requirements emphasize robust user management, data integrity, a temporary password system, dynamic dashboards, event management, and PWA mobile accessibility. The CSE Management Module unifies delegation hour tracking. Temporal data handling across planning and analytics, overtime/recovery integration, and a personal employee space displaying absences by type and validated requests are critical. Absence calculations must respect weekends/holidays and priority rules, allowing specific types to be tracked in hours. Admins must modify any absence (even validated ones) and can directly create/manage absences on the monthly planning (multi-employee selection, copy/paste, recurring templates). Managers/RH must validate others' requests but not their own, have restricted access to admin-only modules, and validate overtime for specific educational sector employees. All data changes must propagate instantly throughout the system. Recent additions include a dynamic notification system, a click outside to close feature for menus, and enhanced user feedback for data synchronization.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central for FastAPI routes and MongoDB models.
    -   **Changes**: Added  Pydantic model. Implemented API endpoints for  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Integrated  into , , and  for real-time updates. Added  endpoint. Updated  to include employee  and . Modified  to prevent managers from approving their own absences and to include , , .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles email notifications.
    -   **Changes**: Updated SMTP credentials multiple times in  based on user input, successfully configured for .
-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: Manages active WebSocket connections and broadcasting messages to connected clients.
    -   **Changes**: Created to facilitate real-time updates across the application.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Visualizes absences and allows interactive creation/management.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmation messages for absence creation, modification, and deletion were refined to reflect synchronization status. The  function was updated to ensure the confirmation modal closes even on error. Optimized  dependencies and removed excessive  statements for imported data. Integrated  hook for real-time data updates.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Admin/Manager interface for absence management and employee view for personal requests.
    -   **Changes**:  was updated to check for  from the backend response and display appropriate messages. Logic already present to prevent managers from approving/rejecting their own requests was verified. JSX syntax error was corrected. Integrated  hook for real-time updates.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages global layout and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented click outside to close functionality for the hamburger menu. Integrated notification system: added state,  to load notifications from the API, replaced mockup data with real data, and updated the notification badge. Increased opacity of background clouds in the hamburger menu. Added Planning Mensuel to the menu items and  for the 'employee' role. Integrated  hook and added a connection indicator.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays an employee's personal dashboard.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected action buttons to navigate () instead of just .
-   ** (New File)**:
    -   **Importance**: A custom React hook to manage WebSocket connections and receive real-time data updates.
    -   **Changes**: Created to abstract WebSocket logic for reusability across components.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively implementing real-time data synchronization using WebSockets.
On the backend, a  file was created to handle WebSocket connections. WebSocket imports and an  endpoint were added to . Crucially,  calls were integrated into the , , and  endpoints in  to broadcast messages after any absence-related operation. The backend was restarted and confirmed to be running.

On the frontend, a new React hook  was created to manage WebSocket connections. This hook has been integrated into  to display a connection status indicator. Further integrations were done in  and  to enable automatic data reloading when a WebSocket message is received, ensuring real-time updates for absence data.

The very last action in the trajectory was restarting the frontend to apply these changes and prepare for testing the WebSocket functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend and then initiate comprehensive testing of the newly implemented WebSocket functionality for real-time updates across various user actions (create, modify, delete absence).
