The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the MOZAIK RH application, primarily addressing critical data persistence issues, refining user authentication, and implementing complex permission logic and data synchronization across the system. Initial efforts focused on fixing frontend bugs and adding new absence creation features, leading to a persistent  error that was resolved by identifying a database mismatch and Pydantic model discrepancies. Subsequent work involved implementing detailed CCN66 leave rules, fixing interactive data synchronization for user profile updates, and a comprehensive overhaul of manager/RH permissions. The most recent focus has been on integrating a global synchronization service into backend absence endpoints and refining frontend messaging.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system featuring a responsive, glassmorphism UI. It includes Excel import for personnel and absence data, auto-generated credentials, and CSE member identification. Core requirements emphasize user management, data integrity, a temporary password system, dynamic dashboards, event management, and PWA mobile accessibility. The CSE Management Module unifies delegation hour tracking. Temporal data handling across planning and analytics, overtime/recovery integration, and a personal employee space displaying absences by type and validated requests are critical. Absence calculations must respect weekends/holidays and priority rules, allowing specific types to be tracked in hours. Admins must modify any absence (even validated ones) and can now directly create/manage absences on the monthly planning (multi-employee selection, copy/paste, recurring absence templates). Managers/RH must validate others' requests but not their own, have restricted access to admin-only modules (Excel import, user management, management des astreintes), and can validate overtime for specific educational sector employees. All data changes must propagate instantly throughout the system. Mascot integration remains a pending visual enhancement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing a global data synchronization system. This involved creating  and integrating it into critical backend endpoints. Specifically, , , and  in  have been modified to trigger the  after any absence-related operation, ensuring that data like leave balances are automatically updated.

During this integration, a  related to the  in  was encountered and resolved by correcting the logger's initialization order and removing a duplicate definition.

On the frontend, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to ensure all data changes are reflected throughout the system. It was confirmed that  already uses the  endpoint for absence creation, which now benefits from the backend synchronization. The current task involves enhancing the user feedback in  by updating confirmation messages for absence creation to explicitly mention synchronization. The AI engineer was in the process of extending this improvement to absence modification () and deletion () messages to provide consistent user experience.
