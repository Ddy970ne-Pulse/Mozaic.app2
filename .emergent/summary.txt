<analysis>
The previous AI engineer’s trajectory systematically enhanced the MOZAIK RH application across several modules. Initially, a new UUID-based leave balance system (System 2) was integrated, involving backend initialization and frontend component integration. This was followed by UI/UX improvements to the monthly planning, including displaying CT balances and streamlining absence addition to a Quick Add feature. Critical bugs in quick-add absence creation (date format, backend deduction) and deletion (UI interaction, date search logic) were identified and fixed, ensuring correct balance updates. Unnecessary UI elements like Multi-Sélection, Templates, test users (including an XSS vulnerability), and informational banners were removed. The most recent work focused on merging Gestion Astreintes and Planning Astreintes into a unified Planning Astreintes module with an enhanced frontend, though the corresponding backend API remains to be implemented.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system for personnel and absence management, featuring a glassmorphism UI, Excel import, auto-generated credentials, and PWA mobile accessibility. It supports robust user management, dynamic dashboards, and a CSE Management Module. Core requirements include precise temporal data handling, overtime/recovery integration, personal employee space, and absence calculations respecting weekends/holidays and priority rules. Admins manage planning, while managers/HR validate requests, with instant notification propagation.

Implemented features include: accurate absence badge display, a complete backend approval/rejection workflow, migration of CP to CA absence types, database-driven absence type configuration, a combined absence analysis report, and a multi-tenant SaaS architecture. A Quick Add Absence feature has been implemented and refined. Significant security enhancements (Options A-G) are now integrated: mandatory , strict Pydantic validation, rate limiting, security headers, CORS, account lockout, audit logging, refresh tokens, GDPR data protection (export/delete), and basic security monitoring. A comprehensive leave balance management system has also been integrated, including APIs for managing various leave types (CA, RTT, REC, CT, CP, CEX), automatic reintegration logic for overlapping absences, and historical transaction tracking. Frontend widgets for displaying balances and transaction history are available and integrated into the employee space. The monthly planning interface has been simplified, and an initial merge of On-Call Management into On-Call Planning has been completed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing the frontend integration and user experience for the merged On-Call Planning module. This involved combining the functionalities of  and  into a single, enhanced  component.

The current  now features:
-   **Full-week display**: Shows days from preceding and succeeding months, with days outside the current month styled in a greyed-out manner.
-   **Employee Color Codes**: Each employee assigned to an astreinte is now represented by a distinct color, displayed in a legend at the bottom of the planning, enhancing readability and quick identification.
-   **Local Create Button Functionality**: The Create button within the on-call modal is now functional for local UI interactions, even though the corresponding backend API () for persisting this data is not yet implemented, leading to console 404 errors.
-   **UI Streamlining**: The old  file has been deleted, and all its references, including navigation menu entries, switch cases, and imports within , have been removed to simplify the application's structure and menu.

The frontend is now visually complete for the new Planning Astreintes experience, but the backend API for astreinte management needs to be created to enable data persistence and full functionality.
