The AI engineer's work primarily focused on critical bug fixes and new feature integration for the MOZAIK RH application. Initial efforts addressed a WebSocket frontend connection failure, leading to its temporary disabling, and a bug where approval/rejection buttons remained visible after action, which was resolved with optimistic UI updates. Major feature implementations include enhancing the absence creation process for administrators to assign requests to any employee, sorting absence requests by date, integrating on-call planning data into the monthly calendar, and adapting the backend  model to support a CCN66-compliant double validation workflow (manager pre-validation, admin approval). A significant challenge involved debugging persistent issues with absence badges not displaying correctly in the monthly planning, which led to multiple iterations, code cleanups, and a root cause analysis identifying date format inconsistencies and incorrect  dependencies for data loading. The latest interaction confirms the badge display issue persists.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system designed for responsive personnel and absence management with a glassmorphism UI. It features Excel import for data, auto-generated credentials, and CSE member identification. Core requirements include robust user management, data integrity, temporary passwords, dynamic dashboards, event management, and PWA mobile accessibility. The CSE Management Module tracks delegation hours. Critical functions include temporal data handling across planning/analytics, overtime/recovery integration, and a personal employee space detailing absences. Absence calculations must respect weekends/holidays and priority rules, tracking specific types in hours. Admins can modify any absence (even validated), create/manage absences on monthly planning (multi-employee selection, copy/paste, recurring templates). Managers/RH validate others' requests (but not their own), have restricted admin-only module access, and validate overtime for specific employees. All data changes must propagate instantly. Recent enhancements include a dynamic notification system, click outside to close for menus, and user feedback for synchronization.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack**: React (frontend with Hooks), FastAPI (Python backend).
- **Database**: MongoDB (using UUIDs).
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism design.
- **Data Synchronization**: Global real-time updates (WebSockets, currently problematic).
- **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT, bcrypt, role-based access control.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs, Pydantic for data validation.
- **Email Service**: SMTP (configured for Gmail).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines FastAPI routes, MongoDB models, and core business logic.
    -   **Changes**:  Pydantic model updated to include double workflow fields (, , , etc.).  and  updated with new  validation. The entire  endpoint was replaced with a comprehensive CCN66 double validation workflow (manager pre-validate, admin approve/reject) including notifications and counter synchronization. WebSocket broadcast calls are integrated but currently impacted by frontend issues. API endpoint  logic was updated to retrieve absences that *overlap* the month, not just start within it.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages active WebSocket connections and broadcasting.
    -   **Changes**: Created and integrated; confirmed to broadcast messages correctly on absence events.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Custom React hook for WebSocket client-side management.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected WebSocket URL construction to properly use  in a Kubernetes environment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Interface for managing absence requests (employee/manager/admin views).
    -   **Changes**: Implemented optimistic UI updates for  and  to immediately hide buttons. Increased automatic refresh interval from 30s to 180s. Enabled admin users to create absence requests for other employees, including an employee selector. Implemented sorting of absence lists (pending, approved, rejected) from newest to oldest. Simplified the view for both employees and admins, removing the tabbed interface in favor of a unified list with status badges. Old admin tab view was removed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Visualizes absences and on-call schedules.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated on-call assignments () from the backend API, displaying employee names for full weeks. Removed duplicate  for on-call data loading. Corrected date format inconsistencies in  to ensure badges display correctly ( vs. day-only). Cleaned up redundant debug logs, unused test data functions (), and conflicting  entries that caused Saturday leave issues. Introduced and updated  to convert full French absence names (from DB) to short codes (for badges).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Global layout, navigation, and notification integration.
    -   **Changes**: Temporarily commented out WebSocket connection status indicator due to persistent frontend connection issues.
-   **New Backend Scripts**:  (for tracking issues),  (to ensure all absences have a status),  (utility for finding overlaps),  (to remove duplicate/overlapping absences),  (to add new workflow fields to existing absences),  (for testing double validation workflow).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **WebSocket Frontend Connection**: Resolve the persistent frontend WebSocket connection failure to enable real-time updates and correct online/offline status.
- **Monthly Planning Badges**: Fix the bug preventing color-coded absence badges from appearing reliably for all absences/employees in the monthly planning.
- **Double Validation Workflow Testing**: Thoroughly test the new manager pre-validation and admin approval workflow from the frontend using newly created pending absences.
- **CSE Unification**: Complete frontend integration and logic for .
- **Absence in Hours**: Finalize display in Planning, Export Paie, and Statistics modules.
- **Analytics & KPI**: Complete missing analyses/visualizations based on user images.
- **Printable Password Document**: Implement generation logic.
- **Checkbox Issue**: Unchecking checkbox bug.
- **Mascot Integration**: Integrate mascot image.
- **User Color Customization**: Implement user ability to personalize space colors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical, recurring issue where color-coded absence badges were not displaying correctly in the  component, specifically for absences in October. Despite multiple previous attempts, including fixing date format inconsistencies in , updating the backend API to include all overlapping absences, and cleaning up  definitions, the problem persists. The last action taken was a screenshot of the October planning view with console logs, which confirmed that only 2 CA badges were visible, rather than the expected 6 absences for that month. The  object is suspected to be empty or incorrectly populated, preventing the badges from rendering. The  was called again to perform a final analysis of this persistent issue.
