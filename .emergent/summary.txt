The trajectory details the evolution of the MOZAIK RH application from a buggy state to a feature-rich, stable platform. The initial work involved critical bug fixing, addressing a  in the  module and resolving severe navigation and memory leak issues that crippled the application.

Once stable, the primary focus shifted to a major feature development: the On-Call (Astreintes) Management module. This was an iterative process driven entirely by user feedback. It started with creating the backend endpoints and a basic frontend UI. User requests then led to a complete refactoring of the date selection logic to be week-based (Sunday-Saturday), a UI overhaul to prioritize this mode for managers, and a fix to ensure the on-call visualization in the main planning view covered the entire week.

The most significant recent change was a user-suggested pivot from displaying on-call duties as a separate colored band to integrating them directly into the calendar grid using a uniform AST code, like other absences. This created a more coherent and professional UI.

Simultaneously, the AI addressed a backlog of bugs in other modules (, , ), notably refactoring  from using static data to being fully state-driven, which fixed non-functional approval buttons and incorrect hour balance calculations. A comprehensive test suite for October 2025 was also created to validate the interconnectedness of all modules. The final user interaction was a query about deployment, indicating the development phase is considered complete.

<product_requirements>
The core product, MOZAIK RH, is a comprehensive Human Resources management application designed to comply with French labor law (CCN66). The primary goal of the documented work was to build and refine a new On-Call Management (Gestion des Astreintes) module.

Initial requirements for this module included manual assignment of on-call duties, compliance checks against CCN66 regulations, a blood-orange color scheme, and automatic integration into the main monthly planning view.

User feedback drove the evolution of these requirements:
1.  **Selection Logic:** The assignment process must be based on full weeks (Sunday to Saturday), as this reflects the operational reality for managers.
2.  **UI/UX:** The interface should be optimized for managers, making week-based selection the default and most prominent option.
3.  **Visual Consistency:** The initial implementation of a colored band under calendar cells was deemed inconsistent. The final requirement was to unify the display, representing on-call duties with a dedicated AST code directly within the calendar cell, identical in format to other absence types (e.g., CA for leave).

Additionally, the work addressed fixing numerous bugs in existing modules like  (non-functional approval buttons, incorrect balance calculations) and implementing a comprehensive test scenario for October 2025 to ensure all systems work together correctly.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Development**: React for the frontend, FastAPI (Python) for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
- **React State Management**: Extensive use of React Hooks (, ) to manage component-level state and drive UI updates, replacing hardcoded data structures.
- **API Development**: Creation of RESTful APIs with FastAPI and Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- **UI/UX Refinement**: Iterative development process based on direct user feedback, focusing on conditional rendering, dynamic CSS, and improving user workflows (e.g., week vs. day selection).
- **Test Data Management**: Creation of a dedicated test data file () and Test Mode toggles within components to facilitate robust, scenario-based testing.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ** (New)**
    -   **Importance**: This is the core component for the new on-call management feature. It contains the UI and logic for assigning on-call duties.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch and heavily modified. The logic was completely refactored from a simple day-picker to a sophisticated week-based selection system (Sunday-Saturday) set as the default. The UI was updated with toggles for selection mode, quick-select buttons for weeks, and specific labels for managers.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the central planning view where all employee absences and on-call duties are displayed. It's the most critical component for data visualization.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent the most significant changes. Initially, it was modified to render on-call duties as a colored band beneath the calendar cells. This logic was then corrected to display the band across the entire on-call week. Finally, it was completely refactored to remove the band system and instead render an AST code directly in the calendar cell, unifying the display with other absence types. This required updating the rendering logic for both the screen and print views, as well as the component's legend.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages employee delegation hours, a legally sensitive module.
    -   **Changes**: A major refactor was performed to fix non-functional approval/rejection buttons. The component was changed from using static, hardcoded arrays to a fully state-driven model using  and . New handler functions (, ) were added to correctly update the status of requests and recalculate employee hour balances in real-time.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the FastAPI backend, defining all API routes and data models.
    -   **Changes**: New Pydantic models (, ) and API endpoints (, , ) were added to support creating and retrieving on-call assignments from the database.

-   ** (New)**
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes the logic and data for on-call assignments on the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to hold mock data for on-call duties and was later updated to include the test data for October 2025, ensuring consistency with the main test data file.

-   ** (New)**
    -   **Importance**: A critical file for end-to-end testing, containing a comprehensive set of data for a full month of activities.
    -   **Changes**: Created to hold a rich dataset including absences, on-call duties, overtime hours, and delegation requests for all employees for October 2025. This data is loaded into various modules via Test Mode buttons.

<current_work>
The most recent work was a significant and successful refactoring of the on-call duty display within the main  component, based on the user's request for a more uniform interface.

Previously, on-call periods were shown as a colored band underneath the calendar days. The final implementation replaced this system entirely. A new absence code, AST (for Astreinte), was created with a distinct orange color. The component's rendering logic, for both the interactive screen view and the static print view, was rewritten to check if a given day falls within an on-call week. If it does, the AST code is rendered directly inside the calendar cell, stylistically identical to other absence codes like CA (leave) or AM (sick leave). The legend was also updated to include the new AST code.

This change successfully unified the visual language of the planning grid, making it more coherent and professional. The implementation was validated with screenshots showing a comprehensive test scenario for October 2025, where AST codes were correctly displayed across full weeks for multiple employees, alongside their other absences.
