<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the MOZAIK RH application, addressing critical bugs, and implementing new features as per user requests. The trajectory began with clarifying the overall plan, prioritizing data persistence, followed by pending UI fixes and feature additions. Key achievements include implementing a robust data backup/restore system with a seed endpoint, harmonizing specific UI elements (hamburger menu tiles, monthly planning contrast), and developing a comprehensive temporary password management system with strong format and initial password storage.

Throughout the process, the AI encountered and debugged several issues, including persistent data loss (resolved by the backup/restore system), UI inconsistencies, and initial failures in email integration due to SMTP authentication problems. The AI made significant progress on backend functionalities such as modifying user models, import/reset password logic, and creating API endpoints for data seeding, temporary password retrieval, and absence modification. However, the trajectory concluded with several pending frontend integrations and new user-reported UI bugs, alongside the unresolved email authentication issue and a new request to integrate a mascot.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is a comprehensive HR management system with the following detailed requirements:
1.  **UI/UX**: Responsive, glassmorphism-style hamburger menu, dynamic colors, compact tile design. Ongoing harmonization to generalize Mon Espace style.
2.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Robust parsing for personnel, absences, worked hours, including French date mapping, auto-generated emails/passwords, CSE member identification. Must prevent accidental data deletion.
3.  **Admin & User Management**: Admin setup, user CRUD, password hashing, individual deletion, and data persistence.
4.  **Data Integrity & Cleanup**: Eliminate hardcoded data and ensure optional fields are stored.
5.  **Temporary Password System**: Secure auto-generated passwords requiring first-login change, now extended to include a permanent  for resets, strong format, and the ability to email credentials.
6.  **Dashboard Data**: Display real-time, dynamic data.
7.  **Event Management**: API and system for Événements à venir.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility (PWA)**: Installable PWA with real-time data.
9.  **CSE Management Module**: Unified module for CSE members, delegation hours (CCN66 compliant), prise de connaissance validation, dynamic delegate selection, and cession (hour transfers).
10. **Dynamic Temporal Data Handling**: Modules (Planning, Analytics, Reports) adapt to new years, filter data by period, and prevent data bleeding.
11. **Overtime & Recovery**: Heures Travaillées integrate into Overtime, and Récupération absences affect overtime.
12. **Personal Space**: Mon Espace for Admin/Manager/RH with personal requests, now including displaying periods taken by absence type.
13. **Absences in Hours**: Allow specific absence types (overtime, delegation, recovery, telework) to be requested and displayed in hours (HH:MM), with 8 hours = 1 day conversion, impacting payroll, planning, and statistics.
14. **Absence Logic**: Ensure absence calculation respects weekends/holidays and implements priority rules (e.g., sick leave interrupts annual leave), correctly affecting remaining balances.
15. **Admin Absence Modification**: Admin must have the ability to modify absence periods even after validation.
16. **Mascot Integration**: Integrate a provided mascot into the login page and throughout the site.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues and new feature requests. The most recent focus was on the persistent email sending failure, which consistently resulted in SMTP authentication errors even after updating the Gmail application password in the environment variables.

Concurrently, the AI initiated work on two new user requests:
1.  **Displaying absence periods in Mes Absences**: The  file was modified to include detailed period displays for each absence type.
2.  **Admin modification of absences**: A new backend API endpoint, , was created in  to allow administrators to update existing absence records.

The trajectory ended with the agent being repeatedly paused, indicating a potential system or communication issue, during which the user provided new explicit requests, including fixing non-functional header buttons, re-addressing the tile hover effect, and integrating a mascot. The email sending issue remains unresolved and is awaiting user verification of Gmail app password configuration. The frontend integration for the newly added backend absence modification endpoint is also pending.
