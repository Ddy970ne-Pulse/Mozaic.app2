The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing the MOZAIK RH application, addressing critical user feedback and feature gaps. Initially, the work involved extensive cleanup of hardcoded test data across both frontend and backend modules, alongside implementing robust user management with secure authentication and a temporary password system. A major effort was dedicated to debugging and stabilizing the Excel import module for personnel data, fixing issues like empty column mapping dropdowns, incorrect date handling (including French formats), and ensuring all optional employee data correctly persisted from the  collection to the  collection. The engineer also refined the dashboard to display dynamic data and implemented an API for events. The latest task involves transforming the application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enable mobile installation and real-time data access, which is currently in progress with the creation of , , and PWA-related assets.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application requires the following enhancements:
1.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Revert UI to original, adapt iOS/iCloud-like hamburger menu with glassmorphism, dynamic colors, logo, and iconized buttons with faster, horizontal animations. Harmonize action button styles across all modules with consistent icon-based gradient designs.
2.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Implement a module for mass data import via Excel spreadsheets. This includes parsing, validation, preview, and crucial backend logic for automatic user account creation with temporary passwords upon personnel import.
3.  **Admin & User Management**: Establish an initial admin account (DACALOR Diégo). Develop a full User Management API (CRUD operations, password hashing) to securely manage all user accounts, replacing hardcoded demo accounts. This includes functionality to modify user email and associated account reset.
4.  **Data Integrity & Cleanup**: Systematically remove all hardcoded demo data from all application modules (users, planning, requests, delegation, on-call, dashboard). Ensure all imported optional fields from Excel (birth date, site, contract, category, hire date, etc.) are correctly stored in user profiles and displayed in the User Management interface.
5.  **Temporary Password System**: Implement a secure system for new users with auto-generated temporary passwords, requiring a change on first login, and specific API endpoints for password management.
6.  **Dashboard Data**: Correct dashboard components to display real-time, dynamic data for statistics, current day birthdays, team presence, recent activities, and department overviews.
7.  **Event Management**: Implement an API and system for managing Événements à venir (upcoming events) on the dashboard.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility (PWA)**: Create an iOS/Android supported application or a mobile-compatible web application installable via screen shortcut, ensuring real-time data access for all relevant users.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main backend file for FastAPI routes, database interactions.
    -   **Changes**:  model updated with extensive optional fields (date_naissance, sexe, site, metier, fonction, temps_travail, contrat, categorie_employe, date_debut_contrat, date_fin_contrat). Logic for user creation during  modified to copy all fields from  to . The  endpoint adjusted to filter MongoDB  field. New endpoint  for overtime module and  for cleaning test users were added.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Global layout and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Hamburger menu was reverted and is awaiting specific user input for preferred style.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Login page.
    -   **Changes**: Cleaned from hardcoded test accounts.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles Excel uploads and data import.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed critical bug where column mapping dropdowns were empty. Implemented robust date conversion for Excel numeric dates to French format (JJ/MM/AAAA). Enhanced logging for debugging mapping and import process. Improved warning messages to show clear details (row, data, correction). Simplified mapping logic to ensure data is correctly sent.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for user management.
    -   **Changes**: All hardcoded test users removed. Implemented a custom confirmation modal for deleting users to bypass browser sandbox restrictions. Added comprehensive display for all new optional user fields (date of birth, gender, site, profession, function, contract type, work time, employee category, contract start/end dates). Added an email modification feature.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages overtime data.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded demo data and mock logic removed, now configured to fetch data from backend APIs.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Monthly planning module.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded mock data removed, now connects to real user data.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages on-call assignments.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded mock data removed, now connects to real user data.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Previously contained mock data.
    -   **Changes**: Thoroughly cleaned, mock data removed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Progressive Web Application (PWA) functionality for MOZAIK RH. This involves making the application installable on mobile devices (iOS and Android) and ensuring real-time data access. The engineer has already created the necessary PWA core files:
-   : Defines the app's metadata, icons, start URL, and display mode.
-   : Enables offline capabilities and intercepts network requests.
-   : The scalable vector graphic icon for the PWA.
-   : A script to handle the PWA installation prompt.

The next immediate step in this PWA conversion is to update the  file to link these new PWA assets, integrating them into the frontend build process. This work directly addresses the user's explicit request for a mobile-compatible application.
