The previous AI engineer initiated the MOZAIK RH application, focusing on PWA conversion and implementing core HR modules. The trajectory involved extensive debugging and feature development. Initially, fixes targeted data persistence, incorrect absence planning due to mapping issues, hardcoded holidays, and a duplicate hamburger menu. The engineer systematically addressed these by refining data models, API endpoints, and UI logic across the frontend and backend. Key actions included dynamic period filtering for absences, consolidating absence application logic, dynamic holiday calculation, user data persistence, and UI unification. Later, the engineer tackled Heures Travaillées import failures, integration of worked hours into overtime, dynamic analytics, CCN66 compliance for delegation hours, and a full refactor of the Mon Espace module. The most recent efforts revolve around unifying redundant CSE/Delegation Hours modules into a new  component, and investigating a missing Mes Demandes tab in , indicating a shift towards module consolidation and UI completeness.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application aims to be a comprehensive HR management system with the following detailed functionalities:
1.  **UI/UX**: Implement a responsive, glassmorphism-style hamburger menu with dynamic colors, logo, and compact tile design for mobile.
2.  **Mass Data Integration (Excel Import)**: Robust parsing and import for personnel, absences, and worked hours. This includes correct French date mapping, automatic absence end date calculation, full row import with optional fields, auto-generated internal emails/temporary passwords, accurate CSE member identification, and proper Catégorie Employé handling, displaying warnings and temporary passwords.
3.  **Admin & User Management**: Initial admin setup (Diego DACALOR), comprehensive user CRUD, password hashing, individual user deletion, and persistence of manually edited user data.
4.  **Data Integrity & Cleanup**: Eliminate hardcoded data, ensure storage and display of all optional imported fields.
5.  **Temporary Password System**: Secure auto-generated temporary passwords requiring first-login change.
6.  **Dashboard Data**: Display real-time, dynamic data.
7.  **Event Management**: API and system for Événements à venir.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility (PWA)**: Installable PWA with real-time data, manifest, and service worker.
9.  **CSE Management Module**: Designate CSE members, manage delegation hours (default 24h, modifiable, compliant with CCN66), and implement prise de connaissance validation with quota alerts. It should also handle dynamic selection of delegates and cession of hours between delegates.
10. **Dynamic Temporal Data Handling**: Modules (Planning, Analytics, Reports) must dynamically adapt to new years, filter data by month/year/custom period, and prevent data bleeding.
11. **Overtime & Recovery**: Heures Travaillées data from imports must integrate correctly into the Overtime module, and Récupération absence requests must automatically affect overtime balances.
12. **Personal Space**: For Admin/Manager/RH roles, Mon Espace should have a distinct section for personal requests, separate from general request validation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a complex set of user requests regarding module redundancy and UI issues. The user confirmed the plan to merge  and  modules into a new, unified  component (Chat Message 443). Concurrently, the user reported that the Mes Demandes tab was not visible in their personal space (), despite the engineer's previous implementation (Chat Message 443).

The engineer investigated  and found that the Mes Demandes tab logic was present in the code, suggesting a rendering or visibility issue rather than a missing feature (Chat Message 445-446). However, the immediate priority was shifted to the CSE module unification.

The very last actions involved creating the new  component (Chat Message 447) and preparing to create the corresponding backend endpoint for cessions (hour transfers) within this new module (Chat Message 448). This indicates the engineer is currently in the process of building out the new, unified CSE functionality, with the Mes Demandes tab visibility issue noted for subsequent investigation.
