<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory involved a sequence of bug fixes, significant feature implementations, and architectural enhancements for the MOZAIK RH application. Initially, it addressed issues like absence badge display, backend approval workflows, CP to CA absence type migration, and multi-tenant SaaS architecture. A major phase focused on a comprehensive security overhaul, implementing critical fixes from Option A through G of a detailed security roadmap. This included mandatory , strict Pydantic validation, rate limiting, security headers, CORS, account lockout, audit logging, enhanced authentication (refresh tokens), GDPR tools, and security monitoring. The latest work involved integrating a full leave balance management system, including backend APIs and frontend components. This integration faced a challenge with MongoDB ObjectId versus UUID consistency, leading to a System 2 migration with UUID conversion for all new leave balance components. The backend for this system has just been successfully integrated and is running.

<product_requirements>
The MOZAIK RH application is an HR management system for personnel and absence management, featuring a glassmorphism UI, Excel import, auto-generated credentials, and PWA mobile accessibility. It supports robust user management, dynamic dashboards, and a CSE Management Module. Core requirements include precise temporal data handling, overtime/recovery integration, personal employee space, and absence calculations respecting weekends/holidays and priority rules. Admins manage planning, while managers/HR validate requests, with instant notification propagation.

Implemented features include: accurate absence badge display, a complete backend approval/rejection workflow, migration of CP to CA absence types, database-driven absence type configuration, a combined absence analysis report, and a multi-tenant SaaS architecture. A Quick Add Absence feature has been partially implemented. Significant security enhancements (Options A-G) are now integrated: mandatory , strict Pydantic validation, rate limiting, security headers, CORS, account lockout, audit logging, refresh tokens, GDPR data protection (export/delete), and basic security monitoring. A comprehensive leave balance management system has also been integrated, including APIs for managing various leave types (CA, RTT, REC, CT, CP, CEX), automatic reintegration logic for overlapping absences (e.g., sickness during paid leave), and historical transaction tracking. Frontend widgets for displaying balances and transaction history are available.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was finalizing the integration of a new, comprehensive leave balance management system into MOZAIK RH. This followed a significant phase of security enhancements and an initial, partial integration of a leave balance package.

The current work involved a complete migration to System 2 (a more complete leave balance package) with a critical adaptation to use UUIDs instead of MongoDB ObjectIds, ensuring consistency with the existing codebase's preference. This detailed process included:
1.  **Backup and Deletion**: Backing up the previously integrated leave balance files and then deleting them to prepare for the new system.
2.  **Code Adaptation**: Copying and adapting the new  and  to ensure all  and  operations correctly generate and handle UUIDs.
3.  **API Simplification**: A new, simplified  was created, as the original package's API was too complex to directly adapt. This new API integrates smoothly with the existing authentication and database structure, utilizing UUIDs.
4.  **Router Integration**: The new  router was integrated into , replacing any previous leave balance router configurations.
5.  **Backend Verification**: The backend server was successfully restarted, confirming it starts without errors and that the new API routes are included. MongoDB indexes for the new leave balance collections were verified to exist.
6.  **API Accessibility**: Basic API accessibility was confirmed (e.g., via Swagger docs), and a 404 response for data retrieval was received (expected as no initial data has been populated).

Additionally, new frontend React components (, ) and related documentation were copied into the  directory.

Run the MongoDB migration script () to initialize leave balances and integrate the new React components into the frontend.
