The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the MOZAIK RH application, primarily focusing on extensive UI/UX refinements and a new KPI reporting feature. Initially, the engineer successfully implemented a true BambooHR 2025 style overhaul, including a left-sidebar navigation and a new color palette. Subsequently, the user requested an improvement to KPI reports, leading to the creation of dynamic charts and selectors within the Analytics module. A major pivot occurred when the user requested to revert to the original MOZAIK RH style, which involved restoring the horizontal navigation, original dashboard, and then specifically the iOS/iCloud-style hamburger menu. The engineer then meticulously adapted the hamburger menu to mimic the login page's glassmorphism aesthetic and dynamic effects, reducing tile size, adding dynamic colors, integrating the logo, and refining action buttons. The final actions involved adding advanced dynamic effects to the deployed hamburger menu, with verification pending.

<product_requirements>
MOZAIK RH is an HR management application compliant with French labor law. The initial problem focused on developing an On-Call Management module with week-based selection and AST code display, alongside improving monthly planning print aesthetics (layout, legend, colors, custom periods for 30 employees) and a global UI modernization, culminating in a BambooHR 2025 style.

Recent user-driven requirements during this trajectory phase include:
1.  **KPI Report Enhancement**: Improve the presentation style of KPI reports, specifically for Personnel Turnover (), by clarifying terminology, improving trend graphs, visual indicators, readability, and strategic color usage.
2.  **Dynamic Charts**: Integrate dynamic and interactive graphs with dropdown selectors (Type, Metric, Period, Department) in the Analytics module.
3.  **UI Reversion**: Revert the application's overall UI to the original MOZAIK RH style from before the BambooHR transformations, specifically restoring the hamburger menu, its iOS/iCloud floating menu with shortcuts, and the original dashboard.
4.  **Hamburger Menu Styling**: Adapt the restored hamburger menu to match the aesthetic of the login page (glassmorphism, blue-indigo gradient, animated clouds), reduce tile size, add dynamic colors to tiles, integrate the MOZAIK logo next to the menu icon, remove the module name from the header, and iconize action buttons.
5.  **Hamburger Menu Dynamics**: Enhance the deployed hamburger menu with dynamic effects similar to the login page's animated background and sophisticated tile animations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (Python backend).
-   **React State Management**: Extensive use of Hooks (, ) for dynamic UI and interactive components.
-   **UI/UX Design**: Iterative design, responsive CSS, glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, animated elements.
-   **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular development with reusable React components.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and responsiveness.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo with React frontend and FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Critical for defining the global layout, navigation, and header.
    -   **Changes**: Initially heavily refactored for BambooHR 2025 (left sidebar). Then, completely reverted to the original MOZAIK RH style (horizontal navigation, then hamburger menu). Further modified to restore the iOS/iCloud floating menu, then adapted to the login page's glassmorphism aesthetic, reduced tile sizes, added dynamic colors, integrated the logo, removed page titles, and iconized action buttons. Finally, updated to integrate animated cloud effects and sophisticated tile animations.

    -   **Importance**: The application's landing page.
    -   **Changes**: Modernized for BambooHR layout, then reverted to its original MOZAIK RH style.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Displays KPI reports and analytics.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly refactored to improve presentation style for Personnel Turnover reports, including dynamic charts with dropdown selectors for various metrics and time periods. Mock data for dynamic analytics was integrated.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The application's login page, setting the initial aesthetic tone.
    -   **Changes**: Examined for its specific styling (glassmorphism, gradients, animated clouds) which served as a reference for styling the hamburger menu. No direct modifications made in this trajectory segment.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main application entry point, manages authentication state and conditionally renders  or .
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed to understand the login flow. No direct modifications made in this trajectory segment.

-   ****: Numerous temporary test pages (, , , , , , , ) were created to validate specific UI changes incrementally.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the deployed hamburger menu with dynamic visual effects to match the sophisticated aesthetic of the login page. This involved:

1.  **Referencing Login Page Styles**: The  component was analyzed to extract specific CSS classes and animation patterns (e.g., , , , animated cloud elements).
2.  **Integrating Dynamic Effects into Layout**: The  file was extensively modified to:
    *   Incorporate the animated cloud background.
    *   Apply glassmorphism to the menu overlay and individual module tiles.
    *   Enhance tile animations with more sophisticated  and  transitions.
    *   Add cascading entry animations for menu items.
3.  **Creating a Test Page**: A new public HTML file, , was created to isolate and showcase these new dynamic effects.

The work's current state is that the code changes have been applied to , the test page has been created, and the AI engineer was about to restart the frontend and take a screenshot to verify the implementation. The goal is to ensure the hamburger menu, when deployed, provides an immersive and visually consistent experience with the application's login screen.
